## Description
* Synchro 9 is a music application where users can search and play audio for their favorite artists and their favorite music videos. 

## How does it Works?

#### Artist Search-Page

*  Users can head to the Artist Search-Page and Search for their favorite Artist. For example let search for an artist/band called "Spyair" as shown below.

</p>

*  After the Search is completed, it will return a box of the artist with their photo, name, and genres. (If applicable). As shown below. 
<p align="center">

</p>

*  It also return the artist top track in which they are playable (the tracks just give a 30 seconds preview of the song)
*  As the image shown below, when users try to play another track, it will automatically pause the previously played track and play the next track selected.

</p>

*  If a users try to search for an unknow artist, it will take them to a now results page ðŸ˜….



#### Videos Search-Page
*  If the Artist Search-Page is not that satisfying, Users can search for their favorite Music Videos. For example let search for a song called "S-ave" by aimer. (As shown below)

</p>

*  If a users try to search for an unknow videos, it will take them to a no results page ðŸ˜….


#### Comments Section
*  The Comments Section was particularly made to get better with redux. In this case users can leave comments about the site by entering a username (or stay anonymous) and write a comment in the comment field. It also leave the exact time and date, when the comment is posted. 
* For example, As the image shown below, let's say we enter a Username as "Fuuka" and leave a comment as "This is Awesome".

</p>

*  A unique aspect I added was an reaction(emoji) to react to other comments. As shown below.

*  The Comments Section is still under production and stills need a backend/database to store the comments data.

## Obstacles and Challenges 

* Artist Seach Page
   * Getting the Spotify API to play music.  
   * Once I got the Sportify API to play music, it was playing all the tracks at once. 
   * (Note to Self: Never Put the volume up so high with headphones on XD)
   * When searching for different Artist, a track from a previous search Artist is playing in the background.
   * Trying to get One track to play and stopping the other played track. 
* Videos Search Page
   * Getting the Youtube API to work.
